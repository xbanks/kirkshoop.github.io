talk to non-dev
be vague
be 'vulgar'

show app - motivate interest

values in space
algorithms not raw
explicit thread - coordination abstraction - pay for play

...

rehash content
'open door' to new vistas - inspire

-----

preplan list of words that you want audience members to repeat if asked. then structure the talk to make those words stick.

values-distributed-in-time
algorithms
virtuous procrastination
opt-in type-forgetting virtual functions
opt-in thread-safety
concurrency agnostic (use with OS thread-pool, TBB, actors, event-loop, etc..)
composable (use with rangeV3 and parallel STL)
adaptable (create observable from callback, future, etc..)

no primitives (raw threads, raw mutex, raw callbacks, promise/future)
