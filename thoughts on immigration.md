they are in my monkey sphere just like you are

innocent until proven guilty is part of the idea that an individual must commit a crime and fail to convince a jury of his peers with the help of a competent defender before a penalty is assigned.
sending an individual through a years-long process that filters out so many and then signing a contract with them that they are welcome to our country should not be broken, without that individual having committed a crime and failed to convince a jury of his peers with the help of a competent defender, shows us to be faithless oath-breakers.

I try to keep all humans in my monkey sphere
