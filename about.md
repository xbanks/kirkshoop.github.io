# Introduction
I love writing code. I am driven to write C++ libraries that provide primitives that contain complexity and reduce bugs in code that uses the libraries. In the past I have written; STL collections using macros when templates were not allowed, `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` when they were not in the standard library, [`range`](https://github.com/kirkshoop/libraries/blob/master/range.h), [`unique_error`](https://github.com/kirkshoop/libraries/blob/master/unique_error.h) and [`unwinder`](https://github.com/kirkshoop/libraries/blob/master/unwinder.h) since they are still not yet standardized and several more. Now I write async libraries like [`rxcpp`](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp), [async](https://github.com/kirkshoop/await) (an awaitable `observable` and `generator`) and [transducer](https://github.com/kirkshoop/transducer). I love to learn and apply new compiler features to achieve better safety and expressivity in my libraries and code.

#Feedback

Developers have said that my code 'reads like poetry', that my code is 'scary until they work in it for a month', that they 'learned a lot and are using what they learned in all their new code', and that I 'lead without leading'.

Testers have said that they have a hard time finding bugs in code written using my libraries. One tester ran bug stats after a joint project building the same code in a modern gc language and C++. He reported that the C++ code, using my libraries and design, had 1/7th the bugs of the gc language code over the same period. Another tester reported that after I left, a new manager joined, and banned my libraries in the same codebase with the same people - the tester said it was nice to have something to do again when the bug rate jumped.

#Interest
 I have been using all spare time to work on some projects that I care about; [`rxcpp`](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp) and [async](https://github.com/kirkshoop/await).
 
 I also to publish what I am learning and doing ([blog](http://kirkshoop.github.io/), [CppCon 2014 talk on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfn9hA-3n6k))
